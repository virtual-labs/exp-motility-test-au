## 1. Wet Mount Slide
 
### Materials Required:
1. Microscopic slides
2. Coverslips
3. Inoculating loop
4. Micropipettes
5. Bunsen burner
6. Cultures: - Nutrient broth cultures of Micrococcus luteus and Proteus vulgaris (young cultures)
 
### Procedure:
 
#### Wet Mount Preparation
 
1. Take a clean, scratch free glass slide.
2. Label the slide with the name of the organism
3. Place 15 - 20 uL of the culture in the middle of the slide
4. Lower a clean cover slip over the drop as though it were hinged at one side avoiding bubbles
5. Examine the preparation under microscope first under 4 x followed by 40 x and 100x magnification
6. Identify the motile organisms
7. Clean up the slide with alcohol first (because it had live bacteria on it), followed by soap and water.
8. Discard the cover slip.
 
#### How to Focus:
1. First focus with the 4x objective on the edge of the coverslip. It is easier to find and focus on than the nearly transparent suspension
2. Find a bubble in the liquid suspension, and adjust the fine focus on the edge of the bubble.
3. Switch to the 10x objective, repeat the careful focusing.
4. Switch to the 40x objective, repeat the careful focusing. 
5. Apply oil and examine with the 100x oil immersion lens, again using the edge of the bubble as a focusing point.

#### Hints:
1. Unstained bacteria are very transparent and difficult to see. Therefore, while focusing, reduce the lighting sufficiently to make the organisms visible. 
2. For proof of true motility, look for directional movement that is several times the long dimension of the bacterium. The movement will also occur in different directions in the same field.
3. Ignore Brownian movement which is a vibrational movement caused by invisible molecules bombarding bacterial cells. If the only movement you see is vibrational and not directional, the organism is nonmotile.
4. If you see only a few cells exhibiting motility, consider the organism to be motile. Characteristically, only a few of the cells will be motile at a given moment.
5. Donâ€™t confuse water current movements with true motility. Water currents are due to capillary action caused by temperature changes and drying out. All objects move in a straight line in one direction.
6. Always examine a wet mount immediately, once it has been prepared, because motility decreases with time after preparation.
 
#### Advantages:
1. Quickest means for determining motility.
2. Useful for determinating cellular shape and arrangement
 
#### Disadvantages:
1. The slide quickly dries out, rendering the organisms immotile.
2. If the organism is pathogenic, there is the possibility of danger to the person in handling viable organisms on a slide.
3. Wet mounts cannot be stored over a longer time.
 
#### Expected Results:
Motility is observed in case of Proteus vulgaris , while Micrococcus luteus is non motile
