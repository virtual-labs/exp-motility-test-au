### Principle:
 
The ability of an organism to move by itself is called motility. Motility is closely linked with chemotaxis, the ability to orientate along certain chemical gradients. Eucaryotic cells can move by means of different  locomotor organelles such as cilia, flagella, or pseudopods. Procaryotes move by means of propeller-like flagella unique to bacteria or by special fibrils that produce a gliding form of motility. Almost all spiral bacteria and about half of the bacilli are motile, whereas essentially none of the cocci are motile.

 

The capacity for true motility or self-propulsion is present in a great variety of cells, but not all of them. The bacteria that show no motion are termed non-motile. However, in an aqueous environment, these same bacteria appear to be moving erratically. This erratic movement is due to Brownian movement which results from the random motion of the water molecules bombarding the bacteria and causing them to move.

 

Most  motile  bacteria  move  by  use  of  flagella, thread like  locomotor  appendages  extending  outward  from  the plasma membrane and cell wall. Motile cells may have one flagellum, but most have several. Each flagellum has a very rigid, helical structure and actual motility results from the rotation of the flagellum in a manner similar to that of a boat propeller. Motility by means of flagella is particularly important for the identification of microorganisms, for instance Bacilli are motile except for the anthrax, which is instead capsular, therefore flagella could be produced to enable the organisms to run away from danger and to move from less favorable to more favorable environment. The same is observed with  Clostridia, all are motile except Clostridium perfringens, which has a capsule. It is also been suggested that motility is an essential feature in the colonization hence pathogenicity of  Helicobacter pylori

 

The positions at which flagella are inserted into the bacterial cell are characteristic for a genus. For example, monotrichous cells have only a single flagellum and if it is located at an end, it is known to be a polar flagellum.
